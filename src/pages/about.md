# About GoldenDog Linux

Hello! I'm **Alexia**, the creator of GoldenDog Linux. My journey with Linux and Mac began over 27 years ago, and that experience is the foundation of this project.

## The Story Behind the Name

GoldenDog Linux is born from nostalgia and respect. In the past, when my PowerPC (PPC) Macs approached the end of their lifecycle, I found new life for them using a legendary distribution called **YellowDog Linux**. It was a project I grew to love and even contribute to.

When the YellowDog project was eventually canceled and Apple moved to Intel (and later Apple Silicon), I felt a strong desire to bring that spirit back. However, "YellowDog" was a registered trademark. As a tribute to that beloved project—and in honor of my own pet **Golden Retriever**—**GoldenDog Linux** was born.

## From CentOS to Debian

The first versions of GDL were built on CentOS 7, but I quickly pivoted to a **Debian base**. The reasoning was simple: Debian offers unparalleled software and driver support, making it a more versatile platform for everyday use.

Today, GoldenDog releases follow the Debian Stable cycle:
- **GoldenDog 1**: (Internal test version) Based on Debian 12.
- **GoldenDog 2**: (Current) Based on Debian 13 "Trixie".
- **GoldenDog 3**: (Future) Will be based on Debian 14.

We use official Debian repositories with security patches and backports enabled by default. This ensures you have the rock-solid stability of Debian with the flexibility to install newer kernels and software when you need them.

## The Future: GoldenDog Server 🚀

With the full refactor of GoldenDog 2, I am finally working on a long-time goal: **GoldenDog Server**. 

Currently on the drawing board, the server variant will focus on:
- **Minimal Footprint**: Only the absolute essentials.
- **Enhanced Security**: Pre-configured firewalls and extra security hardening.
- **Deployment Presets**: Intelligent suggestions for specialized roles. Whether you're setting up a web server (Nginx/Apache with PHP/Python) or a Kubernetes node, GoldenDog will offer optimized presets to get you running faster.

## More than just an OS

What started as a personal Debian rebuild has grown into something I hope others find useful. Whether you're a developer, a gamer, or both, GoldenDog is designed to be your reliable companion. 

By building GoldenDog, I also hope to contribute back to the **Debian ecosystem**—a community and philosophy I deeply love.

Thank you for being part of the pack! 🐶
